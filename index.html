    <p class="about">Bill Watterson played a large role in the development of my worldview at an early age. It's strange to think that a comic strip could have that kind of impact but the subversive undertone and veneration of wonder that Bill Watterson put into his work has stayed with me to this day. For example take this strip...</p>

<p class="about">Or this one...</p>

    <p class="about">Not only do these strips explore subject matter not typically found in the medium but they also succeed in being funny. Which is the point after all.</p>
    <p class="about">I also respect the way he conducted himself as an artist. Though he was pressued for many years to liscence his characters, he never did. Essentially turning down millions of dollars for his principles. He didn't work for fame but for the work itself. Here's a quote of him talking about his process. <q><em>Quite honestly I tried to forget that there was an audience. I wanted to keep the strip feeling small and intimate as I did it, so my goal was just to make my wife laugh. After that, Iâ€™d put it out, and the public can take it or leave it.</em></q></p>
    <p class="about">Since this strip ended in 1995 Bill Watterson has receded out of the world view into a quiet life painting landscapes and avoiding interviews. But his work has never left the cultural sphere. If you're interested in reading what in my opinion is the best comic strip ever written I have included a bibliography of his collected works below.</p>
